  # Usage: git remerge new_first_parent new_second_parent
  #
  # Creates a new merge commit from 2 parents. This operation commits the new merge, so anything in the staging area
  # will be included.
  # Useful for squashing multiple subsequent merges (and their conflic resolutions) into a single merge.
